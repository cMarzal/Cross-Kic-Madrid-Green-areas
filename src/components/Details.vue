        <h4>NDVI</h4>
        <div class="text item">
          Data involved:<br>
          Bands 4 and 8 of Sentinel 2 satellite image.
          Temporal resolution: 16 days

          <br> <br>

          Computation:<br>
          Raster calculation:
          NDVI = (NIR-R) / (NIR+R). Zonal statistics using the NDVI as value raster layer and the census units as zone layer.
          Values: [-1 to 1]

        <h4>Green Space Index</h4>
        <div class="text item">
          Data involved:<br>
          Green spaces from the vector cartography 1/1000 provided by the City Council: urban garden, garden area, garden in patio (polygon features).
          Date 2016.
          <br> <br>
          Computation:<br>
          Spatial query to calculate the area occupied by the green spaces in each census tract, divided by the total
          number of inhabitants.

        <h4>Green Spaces Proximity Index</h4>
        <div class="text item">
          Data involved:<br>
          Green spaces from the vector cartography 1/1000 provided by the City Council: urban garden, garden area, garden in patio (polygon features).
          Date 2016.
          <br> <br>
          Computation:<br>
          Spatial query to calculate the area occupied by the green spaces in each census tract, divided by the total number of inhabitants.

        <h4>Green Space Density</h4>
        <div class="text item">
          Data involved:<br>
          Green spaces from the vector cartography 1/1000 provided by the City Council: urban garden, garden area, garden in patio (polygon features).
          Date 2016.
          <br> <br>
          Computation:<br>
          Spatial query to calculate the area occupied by the green spaces in each census tract divided by the area of the corresponding census tract.
        </div>

        <h4>Green-Space Built-Space Ratio</h4>
        <div class="text item">
          Data involved:
          <br>
          Green spaces and buildings from the vector cartography 1/1000 provided by the City Council. Date 2016.
          Green spaces: urban garden, garden area, garden in patio (polygon features).
          Buildings: buildings, building under construction and undefined building.
          <br> <br>
          Computation:<br>
          Spatial query to calculate the area occupied by the green spaces in each census tract divided by the area occupied by the buildings in the same census tract
